                We agree to many requests not because we want to do them, but because we don’t want to be seen as rude,
                arrogant, or unhelpful.
                Often, you have to consider saying no to someone you will interact with again in the future—your
                co-worker, your spouse, your family and friends.

                <h2>The Ultimate Productivity Hack is Saying No</h2>
                <p>The ultimate productivity hack is saying no.</p>

                <div>Not doing something will always be faster than doing it. This statement reminds me of the old
                    computer
                    programming saying, “Remember that there is no code faster than no code.”</div>

                <p>The same philosophy applies in other areas of life. For example, there is no meeting that goes faster
                    than not having a meeting at all.</p>

                Three days later, you’re overwhelmed by how much is on your to-do list.
                We become frustrated by our obligations even though we were the ones who said yes to them in the first
                place.
